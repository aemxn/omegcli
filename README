Uses the Omegle API to chat to people.

Unimplemented: Giving up and trying randoms, cameras.

Uses readline to do so.

Licence: WTFPL

This took me 6 hours to learn and write and fix bugs in, so don't expect much.

Requires a "likes.json" in $PWD with an array of common shared topics.

Will die unexpectedly all the time due to lack of decent error checking.

Works for me, YMMV.

No warranty, blah blah blah.

I do not claim any copy rights, rites, writes, wrongs or wongs, or hold any trade marks, warks, tarts, farts or plarts against Omegle. They own the backends that this uses.

Written from scratch (ish) using request libraries.

This isn't new, people have been doing this for a while so I hope I'm not being naughty by releasing this:
